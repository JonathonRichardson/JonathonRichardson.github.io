My name is Jonathon Richardson.  I recieved a Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry (with minors in Mathematics,
Physics, and Human Biology) at the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay.  After graduating, I worked for
an Electronic Health Record provider named Epic, where I learned how much I loved software and Computer
Science.  I currently work at the University of Wisconsin - Madison as a Software Developer. 

I am a man of many hobbies, from banjo and guitar to brewing, knitting, chainmaille, and electronics.
The internet has been my friend for many years, providing me information on how to pursue just about
any skill I want, virtually free of cost.  I absolutely love how sites such as Wikipedia and Youtube
have allowed people to share knowledge and skills across the world.

That is the basis of this site;  I would like to put some of the lessons I've learned out there for the
benefit of others like me.  The majority of content on this site will be technology based, but I do plan
to post articles regarding some of my other undertakings.

Science and human knowledge advance as a collective, with each of us building on the work of others. That's
why this site is called "Seeing Further"; everything we achieve or build comes only because of the hard
work of others, and if we don't share our knowledge, anything we build will not be able to truly benefit the
world.
