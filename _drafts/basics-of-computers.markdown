Abstract
========

This article will explain some of the basics of computing.  It is intended to be
a high level introduction into some of the intracacies of computers, to give you
a good understanding of how computers work, which I feel makes us better programmers.

Functions
=========

First, let's go back to high school math.  You may remember a teacher spending a
rather excessive amount of time talking about functions.  At least when I was in
the class, it seemed rather unnecessary.  After all, what is the point of a function?

You may have used things like the "horizontal line test" or the "vertical line test" (used to determine inversibility),
or other methods of determining if a graph represented a function, but the core concept
is that a function is a method of converting an input into an output.  More specifically,
given a certain input, you will ALWAYS get the same output.  For instance `f(x) = 2*x` is
a function, with a single input: `x`.  If you hand `f(x)` an input, such as 2, it will always
spit out 4.

The assumption of functionality is very core to our way of thinking:
